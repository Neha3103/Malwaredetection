## About the Project

Increase of malware and advanced cyber-attacks are now becoming a serious problem. Unknown malware which has not determined by security vendors is often used in these attacks, and it is becoming difficult to protect terminals from their infection. Therefore, a countermeasure for after infection is required. There are some malware infection detection methods which focus on the traffic data comes from malware. 

Types Of Malware 

### Trojans
A Trojan (or Trojan Horse) disguises itself as legitimate software with the purpose of tricking you into executing malicious software on your computer.

### Spyware
Spyware invades your computer and attempts to steal your personal information such as credit card or banking information, web browsing data, and passwords to various accounts.

### Adware
Adware is unwanted software that displays advertisements on your screen. Adware collects personal information from you to serve you with more personalized ads.

### Rootkits
Rootkits enable unauthorized users to gain access to your computer without being detected.

### Ransomware
Ransomware is designed to encrypt your files and block access to them until a ransom is paid.

### Worms
A worm replicates itself by infecting other computers that are on the same network. They’re designed to consume bandwidth and interrupt networks.

### Keyloggers
Keyloggers keep track of your keystrokes on your keyboard and record them on a log. This information is used to gain unauthorized access to your accounts.


## Future Goals

- In this app we have been giving the extracted signature of Images to the model that is we use Multi Classification.
  So in future we want to devlop binary Classification model where the system convers from binary to Gray Scale and detect the Malware if present
